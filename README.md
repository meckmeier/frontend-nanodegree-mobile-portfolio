## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

After completing required Nanodegree courses on performance optimization I am attempting to address performance issues in this project.

My Goal: to complete this project before the end of this month.

Mary Eckmeier

Key elements to address: optimize index.html (per instructions from pagespeed insights)
Resized pizzeria.jpg into 2 sizes (one for index, and one for pizza)
Created a GULP workflow to compress all the files. and constructed a build folder
  
1. Forked repository.
2. Re configure git bash / as my computer failed since i took the course and I can't remember all the setup tasks.
    a. git init
    b. git clone <http link>
    c. git add
    d. git commit

To run a local server for viewing the app: I created a bat file with this command:
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
   and placed in the BUILD directory (i am using the root as my dev environment.)

To create a http site for Pagespeed to evaluate, I used ngrok
(I did try to use the NGROK task in Gulp, but was not successful in implementing it)
    Run NGROK.cmd -- which brings up a new window and navigate to the BUILD directory and type
       ngrok http 8080
   I add a BUILD directory for the compressed files.


####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
